## Instructions

There are two different instructions files. Which one to use depends on your setup:

1. **If you just want to use the hardware we suggest**, then refer to [`standalone.md`](standalone.md).
2. **If you want to use our collection software to capture traffic** generated by a real network with APs and mobile stations that you might not control, then refer to [`generic.md`](generic.md).

### Note about Hardware

There are at least three versions of the supported Asus AP, the RT-AX86U:

1. **RT-AX86U v1**: This is the hardware you must use. It's the only one we support now.
2. **RT-AX86U Pro**: This is not compatible! Don't buy it to use with our software.
3. **RT-AX86S**: This is actually not even an RT-AX86U, and we did not test it!

**BOTTOM LINE**: Just use our software with **RT-AX86U v1**.
